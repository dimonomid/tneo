Brief information on the implementation of unit tests

\section how_tests_are_implemented How tests are implemented

Briefly: there is a high-priority task like "test director", which creates
worker tasks as well as various kernel objects (queues, mutexes, etc), and then
orders to workers, like:

  - Task A, you lock the mutex M1
  - Task B, you lock the mutex M1
  - Task C, you lock the mutex M1
  - Task A, you delete the mutex M1

After each step it waits for workers to complete their job, and then checks if
things are as expected: task states, task priorities, last return values of
services, various properties of objects, etc.

Detailed log is written to the UART. Typically, for each step, the following is
written: 

  - verbatim comment is written,
  - director writes what does it do,
  - each worker writes what does it do,
  - director checks things and writes detailed report.

Of course there is a mechanism for writing such scenarios.  Here is a part of
code that specifies the sequence with locking and deleting mutex explained
above:

\code
   TNT_TEST_COMMENT("A locks M1");
   TNT_ITEM__SEND_CMD_MUTEX(TNT_TASK__A, MUTEX_LOCK, TNT_MUTEX__1);
   TNT_ITEM__WAIT_AND_CHECK_DIFF(
         TNT_CHECK__MUTEX(TNT_MUTEX__1, HOLDER, TNT_TASK__A);
         TNT_CHECK__MUTEX(TNT_MUTEX__1, LOCK_CNT, 1);

         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__A, LAST_RETVAL, TN_RC_OK);
         );

   TNT_TEST_COMMENT("B tries to lock M1 -> B blocks, A has priority of B");
   TNT_ITEM__SEND_CMD_MUTEX(TNT_TASK__B, MUTEX_LOCK, TNT_MUTEX__1);
   TNT_ITEM__WAIT_AND_CHECK_DIFF(
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__B, LAST_RETVAL, TWORKER_MAN__LAST_RETVAL__UNKNOWN);
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__B, WAIT_REASON, TSK_WAIT_REASON_MUTEX_I);

         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__A, PRIORITY, priority_task_b);
         );

   TNT_TEST_COMMENT("C tries to lock M1 -> C blocks, A has priority of C");
   TNT_ITEM__SEND_CMD_MUTEX(TNT_TASK__C, MUTEX_LOCK, TNT_MUTEX__1);
   TNT_ITEM__WAIT_AND_CHECK_DIFF(
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__C, LAST_RETVAL, TWORKER_MAN__LAST_RETVAL__UNKNOWN);
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__C, WAIT_REASON, TSK_WAIT_REASON_MUTEX_I);

         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__A, PRIORITY, priority_task_c);
         );

   TNT_TEST_COMMENT("A deleted M1 -> B and C become runnable and have retval TN_RC_DELETED, A has its base priority");
   TNT_ITEM__SEND_CMD_MUTEX(TNT_TASK__A, MUTEX_DELETE, TNT_MUTEX__1);
   TNT_ITEM__WAIT_AND_CHECK_DIFF(
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__B, LAST_RETVAL, TN_RC_DELETED);
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__C, LAST_RETVAL, TN_RC_DELETED);
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__B, WAIT_REASON, TSK_WAIT_REASON_DQUE_WRECEIVE);
         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__C, WAIT_REASON, TSK_WAIT_REASON_DQUE_WRECEIVE);

         TNT_CHECK__TASK(TNT_TASK__A, PRIORITY, priority_task_a);

         TNT_CHECK__MUTEX(TNT_MUTEX__1, HOLDER, TNT_TASK__NONE);
         TNT_CHECK__MUTEX(TNT_MUTEX__1, LOCK_CNT, 0);
         TNT_CHECK__MUTEX(TNT_MUTEX__1, EXISTS, 0);
         );
\endcode

And here is the appropriate part of log that is echoed to the UART:

\endcode

If something goes wrong, there would be no `"as expected"`, but error and
explanation what we expected and what we have. Tests halted.

I do my best to model nearly all possible situations within the each single
subsystem (such as mutexes, queues, etc), including various situations with
suspended tasks, deleted tasks, deleted objects, and the like. It helps a lot
to keep the kernel really stable.

\section get_tests Get unit-tests


Currently, there is a separate repository with unit tests for TNeoKernel. 

Please note that code of unit tests project is not as polished as the code of
the kernel itself. My open-source time is limited, and I prefer to invest it in
the kernel as much as possible.

There is an "environment" repository, which contains tests and all the
necessary library subrepos: http://hg.dfrank.ru/tntest/_env

You can clone it as follows:

    hg clone http://hg.dfrank.ru/tntest/_env tntest

The single repository with the tests resides here:
http://hg.dfrank.ru/tntest/project_common
